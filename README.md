### Assumptions made in the project

The following assumptions were made in the project:
* Able to create a household without specifying family members
* For grant disbursement endpoint, search via household size
    * Households with matching size will be processed to determine the eligibility of all grants
    * Listing of household will only list by 'house_id'
    * Listing of qualifying members will only list by 'id' and 'name'

*Disclaimer: All grants mentioned here are fictitious and do not reflect actual grants that are being
worked on or implemented by any government ministries.*
